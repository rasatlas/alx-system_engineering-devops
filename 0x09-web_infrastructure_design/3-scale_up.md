- In this version of implementation of the system `load-balancers` and `servers` are replicated. Moreover, each `Nginx Server`, `Application Server` and `Databases` has their own dedicated server.

- The MySQL Databases are set in a master and slave setup. Write is allowed only on master database where as the system can read from slave databases.

- The connection between every tier of the servers is made through secured HTTPS connections to further aid integrity and security of the system.
