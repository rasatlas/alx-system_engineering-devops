- In this version of implementation of the system, `firewalls`, `security certificate` and `monitoring services` are added.

- __Why `Firewall`?__
    - A Firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on the organization’s previously established security policies. At its most basic, the firewall is essentially the barrier that sits between the private internal network and the public Internet. The firewall’s main purpose is to allow non-threatening traffic in and to keep dangerous traffic out.

- __Why `HTTPS`?__
    - To encrypt data in transit in both directions: going to and coming from the origin server. The protocol keeps communications secure so that malicious parties can't observe what data is being sent. As a result usernames, passwords and other sensitive data can't be stolen in transit when users enter them into a form.

- __Why `Monitoring Services`?__
    - The monitoring services are used to detect any performance issues before they affect the end-user. Server monitoring also aids in the comprehension of the server's system resource utilization. This allows us to properly plan the server's capacity.
