## Tasks

__0. Transfer a file to your server__</br>
Write a Bash script that transfers a file from our client to a server:</br>.

Requirements:
- Accepts 4 parameters
    1. The path to the file to be transferred
    2. The IP of the server we want to transfer the file to
    3. The username `scp` connects with
    4. The path to the SSH private key that `scp` uses
- Display `Usage: 0-transfer_file PATH_TO_FILE IP USERNAME PATH_TO_SSH_KEY` if less than 3 parameters passed
- `scp` must transfer the file to the user home directory `~/`
- Strict host key checking must be disabled when using `scp`</br>
Example:
```bash
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./0-transfer_file
Usage: 0-transfer_file PATH_TO_FILE IP USERNAME PATH_TO_SSH_KEY
sylvain@ubuntu$
sylvain@ubuntu$ ssh ubuntu@8.8.8.8 -i /vagrant/sylvain 'ls ~/'
afile
sylvain@ubuntu$
sylvain@ubuntu$ touch some_page.html
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./0-transfer_file some_page.html 8.8.8.8 sylvain /vagrant/private_key
some_page.html                                     100%   12     0.1KB/s   00:00
sylvain@ubuntu$ ssh ubuntu@8.8.8.8 -i /vagrant/private_key 'ls ~/'
afile
some_page.html
sylvain@ubuntu$
```

In this example, I:</br>

- remotely execute the `ls ~/` command via `ssh` to see what `~/` contains
- create a file named `some_page.html`
- execute my `0-transfer_file` script
- remotely execute the `ls ~/` command via `ssh` to see that the file `some_page.html` has been successfully transferred</br>
That is one way of publishing your website pages to your server.
