### General

- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your Puppet manifests must pass `puppet-lint` version 2.1.1 without any errors
- Your Puppet manifests must run without error
- Your Puppet manifests first line must be a comment explaining what the Puppet manifest is about
- Your Puppet manifests files must end with the extension `.pp`

## Note on Versioning
Your Ubuntu 20.04 VM should have Puppet 5.5 preinstalled.

### Install `puppet`
```bash
$ apt-get install -y ruby=1:2.7+1 --allow-downgrades
$ apt-get install -y ruby-augeas
$ apt-get install -y ruby-shadow
$ apt-get install -y puppet
```

You do not need to attempt to upgrade versions. This project is simply a set of tasks to familiarize you with the basic level syntax which is virtually identical in newer versions of Puppet.
